# CodeHub: Combined Programming Language Folder


## Overview

Welcome to **CodeHub**, a centralized folder designed for organizing source codes and learning resources across multiple programming languages and paradigms. This repository serves as a personal and educational collection for solving problems, practicing competitive programming, and managing code snippets in languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

## Folder Structure

The directory is structured for easy access and discoverability. Here’s what each subfolder contains:

- **ALGORITHM-BY-C.P.P**:  
  Algorithm implementations and problem-solutions using C and C++.

- **BEECROWD**:  
  Solutions and code for Beecrowd (formerly URI Online Judge) problem sets.

- **CGPA-COUNTER**:  
  CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculation tools and scripts.

- **COMPITIVE-PROGRAMMING**:  
  Templates, solutions, and resources for competitive programming platforms and online contests.

- **DATA-STRUCTURE**:  
  Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) in various programming languages.

- **JAVA**:  
  Java-based codes and projects, including object-oriented programming exercises.

- **LEARNING-CODE**:  
  Miscellaneous learning resources and sample codes from tutorials, books, or personal exploration.

- **PYTHON**:  
  Python projects, scripts, exercises, and programming solutions.
